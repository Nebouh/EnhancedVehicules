## 🛠️ Technical Details

This mod dynamically patches `Storage Methods` using Harmony to modify internal values such as:

- `SlotCount`
- `DisplayRowCount`

These are applied based on user configuration and capped globally using `GameMaxSlots`.

Supported storage types:

| Storage Type          | Default | Configurable |
|-----------------------|---------|--------------|
| Small Rack            | 4x1     | ✅            |
| Medium Rack           | 6x1     | ✅            |
